            Bitcoin Ordinals Bounce High In One Week
						</h1>
						<p class="text-small">
            The combined market cap of Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens, has risen 682 percent to $137 million in only one week. Of course, what goes up must come down. And likely will go up again.

Ethereum network fees jump 153 percent in 1 month. Ethereum gas fees have been high for a long time, but when they go higher, it benefits Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism. Both Binance and Coinbase see large outflows of staked ether. The Shanghai upgrade, a much anticipated Ethereum update, made it possible for ETH2 stakers to get their ETH back, and that's what they're doing. Consider this a dip before the next big bull run.
Coinbase has moved offshore with an international derivatives exchange.

							Java Programming Language
						</h1>
						<p class="text-small">
							When compared with C++, Java codes
							are generally more maintainable
							because Java does not allow many
							things which may lead to
							bad/inefficient programming if used
							incorrectly. For example,
							non-primitives are always references
							in Java. So we cannot pass large
							objects (like we can do in C++) to
							functions, we always pass references
							in Java. One more example, since there
							are no pointers, bad memory access
							is also not possible. When compared
							with Python, Java kind of fits between
							C++ and Python. The programs are written
							in Java typically run faster than
							corresponding Python programs and slower
							than C++. Like C++, Java does static
							type checking, but Python does not.

							Machine Learning is the field of study

							to learn. Machine learning is actively
							being used today, perhaps in many more
